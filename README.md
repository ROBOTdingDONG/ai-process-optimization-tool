# AI-Driven Process Optimization Tool

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an advanced AI-driven tool designed to optimize business processes, reduce costs, increase profits, and enhance customer acquisition and retention. The tool is built with multiple modules, each serving a specific function to achieve the overall goal.

## Modules

### 1. Data Intake Module
Collects structured data from various internal business systems such as ERP, CRM, IoT sensors, and financial records.

### 2. Analytical Engine
Analyzes data to identify inefficiencies, cost overruns, profitability constraints, and customer dissatisfaction factors. Implements predictive analytics to forecast the impact of proposed changes.

### 3. Optimization Module
Integrates optimization methodologies such as Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma, and Kaizen. Automatically prioritizes and generates high-impact optimization scenarios.

### 4. Simulation Module
Provides virtual simulations for proposed process changes to assess potential outcomes prior to real-world implementation.

### 5. Reporting and Visualization Module
Generates dashboards and visually clear reports, highlighting actionable insights, efficiency gains, and performance metrics.

### 6. Continuous Improvement Interface
Continuously incorporates user feedback and ongoing performance data to iteratively refine optimization recommendations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Python
